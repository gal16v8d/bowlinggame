# Bowling Game

Basic bowling game load from file.
This program will read a file input using a scanner and then it read line by line 
the file and show a meaningful output on standard as a bowling game.
So provide a file path like: E:\\bowlinggame\\src\\test\\resources\\sample.txt
btw you can find a couple of sample input in this project under src/test/resources
It will be processed and mapped by an input parser to show the output.
